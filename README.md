RadioTray Bookmarks XML
===================

Enhanced bookmarks.xml for RadioTray

### Usage

All radio stations are saved to `bookmarks.xml` which is located in `~/.local/share/radiotray`. It is an XML file that uses a nested hierarchy to represent groups and stations. If a bookmarks file isn't at that location, the default `bookmarks.xml` will be copied over.

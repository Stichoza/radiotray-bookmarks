RadioTray Bookmarks XML
===================

Enhanced [bookmarks.xml](blob/master/bookmarks.xml) for RadioTray

### Usage

All radio stations are saved to `bookmarks.xml` which is located in `~/.local/share/radiotray`. It is an XML file that uses a nested hierarchy to represent groups and stations. If a bookmarks file isn't at that location, the default `bookmarks.xml` will be copied over.

See official [documentation](https://github.com/cdelahousse/Radio-Tray-Documentation/blob/master/technical.markdown)
